### Non collinear spin examples (ns=4)

Different types of constraints:

magnetic_penalization='none'        no constraint
magnetic_penalization='r'           constraint on the magnetization component  (r,  .  , . )
magnetic_penalization='r,theta'     constraint on the magnetization components (r,theta, . )
magnetic_penalization='r,theta,phi' constraint on the magnetization vector     (r,theta,phi)
magnetic_penalization='theta'       constraint on the magnetization component  (.,theta, . )
magnetic_penalization='theta,phi'   constraint on the magnetization components (.,theta,phi)
magnetic_penalization='phi'         constraint on the magnetization component  (.,  .  ,phi)
